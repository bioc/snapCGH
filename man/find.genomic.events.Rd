\title{Finds the genomic events associated with each of the array CGH samples}
\description{
  Finds the genomic events associated with each of the array CGH
  samples. Events include whole chromosomal gains and losses,
  aberrations, transitions, amplifications and their respective counts
  and sizes. The hmm states has to be computed before using this
  function.

\details{
  The default parameters generally work. Threshold for merging may be
  changed depending on the expected normal cell contamination and/or
  expected magnitude of the changes. AIC model generally works,
  however, may need to be readjusted depending on how liberal or
  conservative one wants to be in finding genomic events. We recommend
  BIC criterion with delta = 1 for noisier data.
